# Software list for windows computers
This list is used for installing the launchers required to play video games on school computers (for a video game club)

This script will be completely open source and using open source software so that my schools IT department doesnt freak out.

There are 2 versions of a file, a .ps1 powershell script and a .txt text file. They are the exact same but the text file keeps you from accidentally running the file if you just wanted to see what it did. you can rename the .txt to .ps1 and vice versa

All the software listed below will be downloaded using [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org). A free and open source package manager for windows computers. Install chocolatey before running the install script
